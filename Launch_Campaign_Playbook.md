## üì≤ Social Media Launch Campaign

### LinkedIn Campaign Strategy

**Post 1: Problem/Agitation**
```
73% of leads never get followed up. üò≥

Here's what's happening in most businesses:
‚Üí Lead comes in at 2pm
‚Üí Sales rep sees it at 4pm (if they're lucky)
‚Üí First response at 9am next day
‚Üí Lead already chose competitor

Sound familiar? 

Your leads are getting cold while you're playing email tag.

The solution? AI-powered lead management that responds in 3 minutes, not 3 hours.

Comment "LEADS" if you want to see how LeadNest fixes this forever.

**Post 2: Solution/Demo**
```
üéØ From 16% to 23% conversion rate in 30 days.

Here's exactly how Sarah's medspa did it:

Before LeadNest:
‚ùå Manual lead qualification (2+ hours per lead)
‚ùå Leads sitting in inbox for hours  
‚ùå No scoring system
‚ùå 16% lead-to-customer rate

After LeadNest:
‚úÖ AI scores leads instantly (0-100 scale)
‚úÖ High-value prospects routed immediately
‚úÖ Automated nurture for "not ready" leads
‚úÖ 23% conversion rate (+43% improvement)

Result: $47K additional revenue in month 1.

The setup took 15 minutes.

‚Üí 43% average conversion improvement

## üíå Cold Outreach Strategy (Teaser Approach)

### Email Sequence: Cover Page Teasers

**Email 1: Developer Outreach**
```
Subject: 15-min API integration vs 6-week Salesforce nightmare

Hi {{firstName}},

Quick question: How long did your last CRM integration take?

If it was longer than 15 minutes, this might interest you.

We've built an AI lead management platform that integrates in minutes, not months.

I'm not going to pitch you in this email.

Instead, I'm attaching just the cover page of our developer documentation.

If the API architecture looks interesting, reply "DOCS" and I'll send the complete technical package with live testing endpoints.

If not, delete this email and forget we exist. üôÇ

Best,
{{name}}

P.S. - The attached cover page shows our webhook structure and authentication flow. Full docs include working code examples for React and Python.
```

**Email 2: Client Outreach** 
```
Subject: 43% lead conversion improvement (15-minute setup)

Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed {{companyName}} is in {{industry}} - an industry where lead response speed literally makes or breaks deals.

Quick question: How long does it take you to follow up on new leads?

If it's longer than 3 minutes, you're losing money to faster competitors.

I'm not going to pitch you a solution in this email.

Instead, I'm attaching just the overview page from a guide that shows how {{similarCompany}} increased conversions 43% with 15 minutes of setup.

If you want to see the complete case study and implementation guide, just reply "GUIDE" and I'll send it over.

If lead management isn't a priority, delete this and carry on.

Best,
{{name}}

P.S. - The attached page shows the exact results from 3 companies in your industry. Full guide includes step-by-step implementation.
```

**Email 3: Investor Outreach**
```
Subject: $47B market + 43% performance improvement + 92% retention

Hi {{firstName}},

Three numbers caught my attention about your portfolio:

1. You've invested in 7 SaaS companies
2. 4 of them touch lead management/sales ops
3. Combined valuation: $180M+

You clearly understand this space.

So I'll be direct: We're building the next evolution of lead management, and the early results are compelling:

‚Ä¢ $240K ARR in 12 months  
‚Ä¢ 92% customer retention
‚Ä¢ 43% performance improvement for customers

I'm not asking for a meeting in this email.

Instead, I'm attaching just the executive summary cover page.

If the business model and market opportunity look interesting, reply "DECK" and I'll send our complete investor materials.

If it doesn't fit your thesis, delete this and forget we reached out.

Respect your time,
{{name}}

P.S. - The full investor package includes unit economics, competitive analysis, and product demo video. The cover page gives you enough to decide if it's worth 10 minutes of your time.
```

### Follow-up Sequence

**Follow-up 1 (3 days later):**
```
Subject: Re: {{originalSubject}}

Hi {{firstName}},

Following up on my email from Tuesday about {{leadHook}}.

I'm curious - did the {{attachmentType}} cover page spark any interest?

If yes: Reply "FULL PACKAGE" and I'll send everything.
If no: Reply "NOT INTERESTED" and I'll remove you from future emails.
If maybe: Reply "QUESTIONS" and I'll answer them briefly.

Either way, thanks for your time.

{{name}}
```

**Follow-up 2 (1 week later):**
```
Subject: Last email about {{topic}}

{{firstName}},

This is my last email about {{topic}}.

I sent you the cover page of our {{packageType}} last week, but didn't hear back.

Two possibilities:
1. You're not interested (totally fine!)
2. You're interested but swamped (I get it)

If #1: No worries, consider this closed.
If #2: The complete package is still available - just reply "SEND IT"

Either way, best of luck with {{relevantBusinessArea}}.

{{name}}

P.S. - After this sequence ends, the only way to get our materials is through the paid consultation. This is the last free opportunity.
