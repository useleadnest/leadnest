## 📧 Cold DM Templates

### Facebook Group DM (Contractor Communities)

**Subject:** Quick question about lead gen

Hey [Name],

I noticed you're active in [Group Name] and seem to really know your stuff about [trade]. 

Quick question: How much time do you spend each week researching new leads? 

I ask because I just launched a tool that's been helping contractors cut their lead research from 10+ hours down to about 15 minutes per week. It automatically finds, enriches, and exports qualified prospects from multiple sources.

Would you be interested in seeing a quick 2-minute demo? I can show you exactly how it works and you can decide if it's worth your time.

No pressure either way—just thought it might save you some headaches.

Best,  
[Your Name]

P.S. Here's a sample of what the output looks like: [screenshot of CSV with 50+ leads]

### LinkedIn Cold DM

**Subject:** 10 min/week lead research?

Hi [Name],

Saw your post about [specific pain point] in the [industry] space. Really resonated with me.

I'm working with contractors who were spending 10+ hours/week on manual lead research and just launched something that cuts that down to 10 minutes.

The tool finds qualified prospects across Yelp, Google, and industry directories, then uses AI to enrich the contact info and exports everything as a ready-to-import CSV.

Not trying to sell you anything—just curious: Is lead research a time sink for your business too?

If so, I'd love to show you a quick demo. Takes 2 minutes and might save you hours each week.

Sound interesting?

Best,  
[Your Name]

Subject: How Mike got 40% more clients

Hi [Name],

Quick success story for you:

Mike Rodriguez runs a roofing company in Dallas. Before LeadNest, he spent every Sunday morning researching leads—usually found 15-20 prospects after 4+ hours of work.

Last month, Mike used LeadNest to generate 847 qualified roofing prospects in under 2 hours total. His close rate went from 12% to 17% because the leads were more targeted.

The result? 40% more clients and he got his Sundays back.
