# LeadNest Outreach Scripts - Ready to Send Today

## DM Script (Instagram/Facebook)

```
Hey [Business Name], 

Saw your [specific detail about their business] and had to reach out. 

We just built LeadNest to solve the #1 problem service businesses face - missing leads when you're busy, after hours, or on calls.

Our 24/7 AI receptionist books appointments automatically. The businesses using it are closing 30-50% more inbound calls because nothing slips through the cracks.

Can I show you a 10-minute demo today? We're onboarding our first 5 clients at a founders' discount.

Here's my calendar: [YOUR_CALENDLY_LINK]

If it doesn't book you leads this week, you don't pay.

Subject: Stop missing leads - 10min demo?

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Business Name] and wanted to reach out about something that could dramatically increase your bookings.

We just launched LeadNest - a 24/7 AI receptionist that books appointments automatically when customers text or call your business.

The problem: You're probably missing 40-60% of potential customers because:
- Calls come in while you're with clients  
- Texts arrive after hours or on weekends
- Follow-up gets delayed when you're busy

The solution: Our AI answers every inquiry in under 30 seconds, qualifies the lead, and books them directly to your calendar.

Service businesses using LeandNest are closing 30-50% more leads because nothing falls through the cracks.

Would you like to see a 10-minute demo? We're offering our first 5 clients a founders' discount and a guarantee: if it doesn't book you leads this week, you don't pay.

Book here: [YOUR_CALENDLY_LINK]

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - We can have you set up and live within 24 hours. Most clients see their first AI-booked appointment within 48 hours.
```

## Follow-up Sequences

### Follow-up #1 (if no response after 3 days)
```
Quick follow-up on LeadNest - 

I know you're busy (that's exactly why this works so well).

Just had a med spa go from 30% to 64% booking rate in their first week. That's an extra $8,500/month in revenue.

Worth 10 minutes to see if it works for [Business Type]?

### Follow-up #2 (if no response after 1 week)  
```
Last quick note about LeadNest -

I'm closing our founders' pricing in 48 hours. After that, setup goes from FREE to $500.

If you've ever lost a customer because you couldn't answer fast enough, this is specifically built for that problem.

Otherwise, no worries - best of luck with everything!

## Objection Responses

### "We don't get that many calls/texts"
```
That's actually perfect - makes it even easier to see the ROI. 

Even if you only get 10 inquiries a month, turning 7 into customers instead of 3 pays for LeadNest twice over.

Plus, you'll be amazed how many more inquiries you get when people know they'll get an instant response.
```

### "Customers won't like talking to AI"
```
I thought the same thing! But 90% of people can't tell it's AI, and the 10% who figure it out are usually impressed.

More importantly - they prefer an instant helpful response over waiting hours for you to call back.

Would you rather lose the lead or have AI book them while you're busy?
```

### "We already have a booking system"
```
Perfect - LeadNest integrates with everything. Google Calendar, Outlook, Calendly, you name it.

It's not replacing your booking system, it's making sure customers actually USE it instead of hanging up or texting competitors.
```

### "Sounds expensive"
```
Most of our clients make back the monthly cost from their first AI-booked appointment.

Med spa treatment = $400. Pool estimate that closes = $8,000. Dental cleaning = $200.

Even one extra booking per month pays for itself. Most see 5-10 additional bookings.
```

## Target Business Types & Angles

### Med Spas
- "Stop losing Botox consultations to competitors who respond faster"
- "Book more consultations while you're doing procedures"

### Pool Contractors  
- "Never miss another estimate request during busy season"
- "$50k pool job starts with a text you might miss"

### Law Firms
- "Potential clients call 3-5 lawyers. First to respond wins the case"
- "Capture consultations 24/7, even when you're in court"

### Salons/Spas
- "Book appointments while you're doing hair/nails"  
- "Handle cancellations and reschedules automatically"

### HVAC/Plumbing
- "Emergency calls at midnight? AI books them instantly"
- "Estimate requests during the day while you're on jobs"

## Sample Social Media Posts

Just helped a local med spa increase their booking rate from 30% to 64% in one week.

The secret? A 24/7 AI receptionist that books appointments while they're busy with clients.

Service businesses are losing 40-60% of potential customers to slow response times.

If you've ever thought "I wonder how many customers I lost because I couldn't answer fast enough" - this is the solution.

Quick question for service business owners:

How many potential customers do you think you lose because you can't answer calls/texts fast enough?

Just launched an AI receptionist that's been getting insane results - 30-50% more bookings for the businesses testing it.

Anyone else dealing with this problem?
