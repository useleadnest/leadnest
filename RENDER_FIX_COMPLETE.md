🎯 RENDER DEPLOYMENT FIX - COMPLETED
==========================================

✅ FIXED ISSUES:
1. ❌ Deleted .runtime.txt (with dot) - Render doesn't recognize this
2. ✅ Created runtime.txt (no dot) with python-3.10.13 in root directory
3. ✅ Updated backend/runtime.txt to python-3.10.13 
4. ✅ Confirmed requirements.txt has compatible versions:
   - fastapi==0.103.0
   - pydantic==1.10.13
   - uvicorn==0.22.0
   - python-dotenv
   - email-validator
   - requests
   - httpx
   - stripe

✅ COMMITTED TO GITHUB:
- All changes pushed to main branch
- runtime.txt files are correct
- No .runtime.txt files remain

🚀 NEXT STEP - MANUAL RENDER DEPLOY:
====================================
1. Go to Render.com → Services → leadnest-api-final
2. Click "Manual Deploy"
3. ✅ CHECK "Clear build cache" (CRITICAL!)
4. Click "Deploy latest commit"

🎯 EXPECTED SUCCESS:
===================
After deployment, https://api.useleadnest.com/ should return:
{
  "status": "healthy", 
  "service": "leadnest-api",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "..."
}

All auth endpoints should also work:
- /api/auth/register
- /api/auth/login  
- /api/auth/me

✅ ALL FILES READY FOR RENDER DEPLOYMENT!
