# Cold DM Response Flows for LeadNest

**Complete conversation flows for every response type**

---

## ü§î "How does it work?"

### Response A (Technical Explanation):
*"Great question! Here's the simple version:*

*1. You enter a location (like 'Dallas, TX') and trade (like 'roofing')*
*2. Our system searches Yelp, Google Business, and industry directories simultaneously*
*3. It finds all contractors matching your criteria with contact info, ratings, reviews*
*4. Optional: AI enrichment adds emails, phone numbers, and business insights*
*5. One-click export to CSV for your CRM or email campaigns*

*The whole process takes about 2 minutes vs. 10+ hours of manual research.*

*Want me to show you a quick demo? Takes 60 seconds."*

### Response B (Benefit-Focused):
*"It's like having a research assistant who works 100x faster than you do.*

*Instead of spending your weekend clicking through Yelp pages and copying contact info into spreadsheets, you just tell LeadNest what you're looking for and it delivers a perfect list in minutes.*

*For example: 'Find me 50 solar installers in Phoenix' ‚Üí 2 minutes later you have a CSV with names, phone numbers, emails, ratings, and business details.*

*Would a quick screen-share demo be helpful? I can show you exactly how it works."*

---

## üí∞ "How much does it cost?"

### Response A (Value First):
*"Fair question! Let me put it in perspective first:*

*If you spend 10 hours/week on lead research (most contractors do), that's 520 hours per year. At $25/hour value, that's $13,000 worth of your time annually.*

*LeadNest is $49/month ($588/year) and cuts that research time to maybe 1 hour/week. So you're saving $12,400+ per year while getting better, more targeted leads.*

*Plus your first 25 leads are free to try. Want to see if it works for your business first?"*

### Response B (Simple Pricing):
*"$49/month for unlimited searches and exports. But here's the thing - most contractors make that back with just one additional client from better lead targeting.*

*We also have a free plan with 25 leads/month to test it out. No credit card required.*

*Would you like to try the free version first and see if it actually saves you time?"*

---

## ‚è∞ "I don't have time for this right now"

### Response A (Time-Saver Angle):
*"I totally get it - that's exactly why I built this tool! Contractors are slammed and don't have time for more complicated processes.*

*But here's the thing: this actually SAVES you time. Instead of spending 3-4 hours this weekend researching leads, you could spend 10 minutes and get the same results.*

*Quick question: when do you usually do your lead research? Evenings? Weekends?*

*What if I could show you how to get that time back?"*

### Response B (Defer and Follow-Up):
*"Completely understand - timing is everything in this business.*

*Mind if I follow up in a couple weeks when things settle down? In the meantime, I'll send you a quick 60-second demo video so you can see what it's about when you have a free minute.*

*Fair enough?"*

---

## ü§ñ "I don't trust AI"

### Response A (Human-Controlled AI):
*"I hear you - and honestly, a lot of contractors feel the same way initially.*

*The good news is you're in complete control. The AI doesn't make decisions for you - it just speeds up the boring research work.*

*Think of it like using GPS instead of a paper map. The AI finds the information faster, but you still decide which leads to call and what to say.*

*The core tool is just automated searching across Yelp and Google. The AI part is optional and just adds extra contact details.*

*Would you be more comfortable seeing how the basic search works first?"*

### Response B (Prove with Results):
*"Totally fair - AI skepticism is healthy, especially in the trades.*

*How about this: try the basic lead search feature first (no AI involved). It just automates what you're already doing on Yelp and Google.*

*If that saves you time and the data looks good, then maybe we can talk about the AI features. But start simple.*

*Would a basic demo make sense? Just straight lead searching, no fancy AI stuff."*

## üè† "I already pay HomeAdvisor/Angie's List"

### Response A (Complement, Don't Replace):
*"Makes sense - HomeAdvisor can be great for inbound leads when customers are actively looking.*

*This is different though - it's for outbound prospecting when you want to find specific types of contractors for partnerships, subcontracting, or competitive research.*

*Like if you needed to find 20 solar installers in your area for a partnership opportunity, or wanted to see who your main competitors are. HomeAdvisor doesn't help with that kind of research.*

*Are you doing any outbound prospecting right now, or is it all inbound through HomeAdvisor?"*

### Response B (Cost Comparison):
*"HomeAdvisor is expensive per lead, right? I hear contractors paying $50-200+ per lead depending on the trade.*

*This is different - it's unlimited lead research for $49/month total. So instead of paying per lead, you're paying for the tool to find unlimited leads.*

*Think of HomeAdvisor as your inbound lead source, and LeadNest as your outbound prospecting tool. They complement each other.*

*Want to see how it could supplement what you're already doing?"*

---

## üîÑ "I'll think about it"

### Response A (Remove Friction):
*"Absolutely - no pressure at all.*

*Quick thought: instead of thinking about it in the abstract, would it help to just try the free version? 25 free leads, no credit card required.*

*Then you can see exactly what kind of data you get and whether it's useful for your business.*

*Worst case, you spent 5 minutes testing it out. Best case, you find your new favorite business tool.*

*Sound reasonable?"*

### Response B (Follow-Up Framework):
*"Totally understand - these decisions shouldn't be rushed.*

*Mind if I ask what you'd need to see to feel confident about trying it? Is it about the data quality, the pricing, or something else?*

*I find it helps to know what specific concerns I can address.*

*And no worries if it's just not the right time - I can follow up in a month or two when things might be different."*

---

## üìä "Do you have proof this works?"

### Response A (Specific Results):
*"Great question! Here are some real numbers:*

*- Mike Rodriguez (Dallas roofing) found 847 qualified prospects in his first month, increased close rate 40%*
*- Sarah Chen (Phoenix solar) replaced 10+ hours of weekend research with 30 minutes total*
*- Tommy's HVAC (Miami) identified 15 new partnership opportunities in 2 weeks*

*I can also show you a live demo with real data for your area. Want to see what results you'd get for your specific trade and location?"*

### Response B (Offer Proof):
*"Absolutely - results matter more than promises.*

*How about this: give me your location and trade, and I'll run a live search right now. You can see exactly what kind of data you'd get and judge the quality yourself.*

*Takes 2 minutes and you'll know immediately if it's worth your time.*

*What's your trade and general area?"*

---

## üö´ "Not interested"

### Response A (Find the Real Objection):
*"No worries at all - I appreciate the honesty.*

*Mind if I ask what made you decide against it? Is it not a fit for your business model, bad timing, or something else?*

*I'm always trying to understand when this tool is helpful vs. when it's not, so any feedback helps."*

### Response B (Future Follow-Up):
*"Completely understand - not every tool is right for every business.*

*Mind if I keep you on my list for occasional updates? I won't spam you, but if we add features that might be more relevant to your situation, I'd love to let you know.*

*Either way, best of luck with your business!"*

---

## ‚ùì "Sounds too good to be true"

### Response A (Address Skepticism):
*"I get that reaction a lot - honestly, if someone told me this a year ago, I'd be skeptical too.*

*The reality is, this isn't revolutionary technology. It's just automating the manual work you're probably already doing on Yelp and Google.*

*Instead of clicking through 50 Yelp pages and copying info to a spreadsheet, the software does that clicking and copying for you.*

*The 'magic' is just speed and automation, not some crazy new invention.*

*Would seeing exactly how it works help address the skepticism?"*

### Response B (Prove It Live):
*"Healthy skepticism! Let me prove it works instead of just talking about it.*

*Give me a location and trade type, and I'll run a live search right now. You can watch the results come in real-time and judge for yourself.*

*If it's not as good as I'm claiming, you'll know in 2 minutes.*

*What area and trade should we test?"*

---

## üîß "My current process works fine"

### Response A (Efficiency Angle):
*"That's great - having a process that works is huge.*

*Quick question: about how long does your current lead research take per week? And how many qualified prospects do you typically find?*

*I'm not trying to fix something that's broken, just wondering if we could make something that works even more efficient.*

*Like, if you could get the same results in 90% less time, would that be interesting even if your current process works?"*

### Response B (Enhancement Not Replacement):
*"Love hearing that - so many contractors struggle with lead gen, so it's great you have it figured out.*

*I'm curious: what does your process look like? Are you using Yelp, Google, referrals, or something else?*

*Not trying to replace what works, just wondering if there's a way to enhance it or make it even more efficient.*

*Sometimes the best improvements come when things are already working well."*

---

## üìû "Can we schedule a call?"

### Response A (Immediate Value):
*"Absolutely! I'd love to show you how this would work specifically for your business.*

*Before we schedule though, let me ask a couple quick questions so I can make the call super relevant:*

*1. What's your primary trade/specialty?*
*2. About how much time do you spend on lead research now?*
*3. What's your biggest challenge with finding new prospects?*

*I have availability [specific times]. What works better for you?"*

### Response B (Demo Focused):
*"Perfect! I find a quick screen-share demo is the best way to see if this is a fit.*

*I can show you exactly what results you'd get for your specific location and trade, plus answer any questions.*

*How about a 15-minute call? I have [specific availability]. What works for your schedule?"*
