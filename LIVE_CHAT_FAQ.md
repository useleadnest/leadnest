## 🔍 Lead Scraping Questions

### **Q: "How do I search for leads in my area?"**
**A:** Great question! Here's how to find leads in your area:

1. Click "Find Leads" from your dashboard
2. Enter your location (city, state, or ZIP code)
3. Select your trade (roofing, HVAC, plumbing, etc.)
4. Choose your search radius (5-50 miles)
5. Hit "Search" and we'll find fresh leads for you!

The system searches multiple sources including permit records, insurance claims, and business directories. Need help with a specific search? I'm here! 😊

---

### **Q: "Why am I not finding any leads?"**
**A:** Let's troubleshoot this together! A few things to check:

✅ **Location:** Make sure your city/state is spelled correctly
✅ **Radius:** Try expanding your search radius to 25-50 miles  
✅ **Trade:** Double-check you selected the right service category
✅ **Timing:** Some areas have seasonal variations - try different date ranges

If you're still not seeing results, there might genuinely be fewer opportunities in your specific area right now. Would you like me to run a test search for you? Just share your location and trade! 🎯

### **Q: "How accurate is the contact information?"**
**A:** We work hard to provide the most accurate data possible! Here's what you can expect:

## 🤖 AI Enrichment Questions

### **Q: "What does AI enrichment mean?"**
**A:** Great question! AI enrichment means we use artificial intelligence to add valuable context to each lead:

🏠 **Property insights:** Home age, size, estimated value, recent sales
💰 **Financial indicators:** Estimated income, homeownership length  
📱 **Digital presence:** Website, social media, online reviews
🎯 **Pain points:** Likely needs based on property age/type
📝 **Personalization:** Talking points for your outreach

**Example:** Instead of just "John Smith, 555-1234", you get:
"John Smith - Owns 1995 colonial home (~$400K value), likely needs roof replacement soon, found via storm damage claim, very active on Facebook"

This helps you write personalized messages that actually get responses! 🎯

---

### **Q: "How accurate is the AI information?"**
**A:** Our AI combines multiple data sources for maximum accuracy:

📊 **Property data:** 95%+ accurate (public records)
💰 **Financial estimates:** ~80% accurate (modeled data)  
🏠 **Home insights:** ~85% accurate (recent sales, permits)
📱 **Digital presence:** 90%+ accurate (real-time scraping)

**Important:** Use AI insights as conversation starters, not absolute facts. For example, "I noticed your home was built in 1995 - many homeowners around that time are starting to think about roof replacement. Is that something you've considered?"

The AI is designed to give you an edge in your outreach, not replace your expertise! 🤖

---

### **Q: "Can I turn off AI enrichment?"**
**A:** You can control AI features in your account settings:

⚙️ **Settings → AI Preferences**

## 💡 Strategy & Best Practices

### **Q: "How do I write good messages to leads?"**
**A:** Great question! Here are proven templates that work:

📝 **The Local Connection:**
"Hi [Name], I noticed you're in [City] and saw you might need [service]. I'm [Your Name] from [Company] - we've helped several neighbors on [Street Name] with similar projects. Would you like a quick estimate?"

🏠 **The Property-Specific:**  
"Hi [Name], I saw your [year built] home on [Street] and know many homeowners in that area are dealing with [common issue]. We specialize in [solution] for homes exactly like yours. Free to chat?"

⚡ **The Urgency (for storm damage):**
"Hi [Name], I saw the recent storm damage report for your area. We're helping [City] homeowners with insurance claims and quick repairs. Can I provide a free damage assessment?"

**Key tips:**
- Always mention their location
- Reference specific property details  
- Offer value (free estimate/assessment)
- Keep it short (under 50 words)

### **Q: "What's the best time to contact leads?"**
**A:** Timing makes a huge difference! Here's what works:

⏰ **Best days:** Tuesday-Thursday
⏰ **Best times:** 10 AM - 12 PM, 2 PM - 4 PM
⏰ **Avoid:** Monday mornings, Friday afternoons, weekends

📞 **Phone calls:**
- Morning (9-11 AM) for business owners
- Afternoon (2-5 PM) for homeowners
- Never after 7 PM or before 8 AM

📧 **Emails:**
- Tuesday 10 AM gets highest open rates
- Thursday 2 PM gets good responses  
- Avoid Friday afternoons

📱 **Text messages:**
- Between 12-6 PM only
- Never on weekends unless urgent

**Pro tip:** Use the "Last Active" data in your leads to time your outreach when they're most likely online! ⏰

---

### **Q: "How many leads should I contact per day?"**
**A:** This depends on your capacity and goals:

🎯 **Beginner (1-2 hours/day):** 20-30 leads
🎯 **Experienced (3-4 hours/day):** 50-75 leads  
🎯 **Full-time (6+ hours/day):** 100-150 leads

**Quality over quantity:** Better to send 25 personalized messages than 100 generic ones.

📊 **Typical conversion rates:**
- 15-20% response rate
- 10-15% of responses become quotes
- 20-30% of quotes become jobs

**So for 100 contacts:** ~15 responses → ~2 quotes → ~0.5 jobs

**Pro tip:** Track your numbers for 2 weeks to find your optimal daily volume. Start smaller and scale up as you improve! 📈
