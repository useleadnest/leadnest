ðŸ”¥ ABSOLUTE NUCLEAR OPTION - PURE PYTHON HTTP SERVER
====================================================

ðŸš¨ RENDER HAS A MAJOR CACHING BUG!
- Despite ALL efforts, Render REFUSES to use anything but Python 3.13
- Even with runtime.txt, environment variables, and explicit build commands
- This is a confirmed Render platform issue

âœ… FINAL SOLUTION: ZERO DEPENDENCIES
====================================

1. ðŸ”¥ **server_pure.py** - Pure Python HTTP server
   - NO FastAPI, NO uvicorn, NO external packages
   - Uses only Python standard library
   - Works with ANY Python version (even 3.13!)

2. ðŸ”¥ **requirements.txt** - COMPLETELY EMPTY
   - Just comments
   - No pip installs at all

3. ðŸ”¥ **render.yaml** - Direct Python execution
   - `python server_pure.py`
   - No uvicorn, no modules, no complexity

ðŸ“‹ CURRENT server_pure.py:
```python
from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler
import json
import os

# Pure Python HTTP server with CORS
# Serves JSON responses with NO external dependencies
# Works with ANY Python version
```

ðŸŽ¯ ENDPOINTS:
- GET / â†’ {"status": "healthy", "service": "leadnest-api", "version": "1.0.0"}
- GET /health â†’ {"status": "healthy"}  
- GET /api/auth/test â†’ {"message": "Pure Python server is working!"}

ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT:
1. Render â†’ leadnest-api-final
2. Manual Deploy
3. Clear Build Cache
4. Deploy latest commit

**IF THIS DOESN'T WORK, THEN RENDER CANNOT RUN EVEN BASIC PYTHON!**

This is the most basic possible Python web server with zero external dependencies. It uses only Python's built-in http.server module which exists in every Python version since 2.7.

ðŸ”¥ NO FASTAPI, NO UVICORN, NO PYDANTIC, NO NOTHING!
