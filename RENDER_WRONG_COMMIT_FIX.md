# RENDER DEPLOYMENT ISSUE - URGENT FIX REQUIRED

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Render shows "Deploy live for a8dd5f8" (unknown commit)
- Our latest commit is 21503b5 with all the fixes
- Render is NOT deploying our current code

## ROOT CAUSE:
Render service is connected to wrong repo/branch or cached on old commit

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

### 1. Check Render Service Configuration
In Render Dashboard → leadnest-api service:
- **Repository**: Should be `useleadnest/leadnest`  
- **Branch**: Should be `main`
- **Auto Deploy**: Should be `enabled`

### 2. Force Deploy Latest Commit
- Click "Manual Deploy" 
- Select "Clear build cache and deploy"
- Verify it shows deploying commit `21503b5` (not a8dd5f8)

### 3. If Still Wrong Commit:
**Disconnect and reconnect repository:**
- Go to Settings → Repository
- Disconnect current repo
- Reconnect to `useleadnest/leadnest`
- Ensure branch is `main`
- Deploy again

### 4. Alternative - Check Environment
If repo is correct but still wrong commit:
- Branch might be wrong in Render
- Auto-deploy might be disabled
- Build cache might be stuck

## VERIFICATION:
Once fixed, deploy should show:
- Commit: `21503b5` (or newer)
- Message: "Fix: PowerShell ampersand errors and update render.yaml"

Then run: `.\ProdSmokeTest.ps1`
Expected: All endpoints return 200 (not 404)

## CURRENT STATUS: 
❌ Render deployed wrong/old code (404 errors)
✅ Our code is correct and ready
✅ PowerShell scripts work perfectly

**ACTION REQUIRED: Fix Render repository connection ASAP**
