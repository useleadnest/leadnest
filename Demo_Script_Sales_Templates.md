# LeadNest Demo Video Script & Sales Templates

## ðŸŽ¬ 10-Minute Product Demo Video Script

### Opening Hook (0:00-0:30)
**[Screen: LeadNest dashboard with real-time leads flowing in]**

**Narrator:** "What if you could increase your lead conversion by 43% in the next 15 minutes? I'm about to show you how LeadNest's AI-powered lead management platform transforms businesses from lead capture to closed deals. Let's dive in."

### Section 1: AI Lead Scoring (0:30-2:30)
**[Screen: Live lead scoring in action]**

**"Here's Sarah, a potential client who just submitted a contact form. Watch this - LeadNest's AI instantly analyzes 47 data points and assigns her a lead score of 87 out of 100. 

[Highlight scoring factors appearing on screen]
- Company size: 50+ employees âœ…
- Budget indicators: Premium plan interest âœ…  
- Engagement level: Downloaded multiple resources âœ…
- Timing signals: 'Need solution ASAP' in message âœ…

This AI scoring happens in real-time for every single lead. No manual qualification needed. Sarah gets routed immediately to your top closer, while lower-scoring leads enter nurture sequences."

### Section 2: ROI Dashboard (2:30-4:30)
**[Screen: Real-time analytics dashboard]**

**"Now let's look at your ROI dashboard - this is where LeadNest really shines. 

[Point to metrics on screen]
- This month: $47,000 in attributed revenue
- Lead-to-customer conversion: 23% (up from 16%)
- Average deal size: $2,300 (up 31% since implementing)
- Time to first contact: 3 minutes (industry average is 2+ hours)

See this red alert? That's LeadNest telling you that lead response time increased to 8 minutes yesterday - still great, but it's tracking the trend and suggesting optimization."

### Section 3: Automated Nurture Sequences (4:30-6:30)
**[Screen: Email automation workflow]**

**"For leads that aren't sales-ready yet, LeadNest's smart nurture sequences take over automatically.

[Show workflow visualization]
- Day 1: Welcome email with ROI calculator
- Day 3: Case study matching their industry  
- Day 7: Personal video from account executive
- Day 14: Limited-time demo offer

But here's the smart part - if John downloads that case study on day 2, the AI immediately bumps his score and alerts your team. The sequences adapt based on behavior, not just time."

### Section 4: Shared Inbox Collaboration (6:30-8:00)
**[Screen: Team collaboration features]**

**"Your entire team stays coordinated with LeadNest's shared inbox. When high-value prospect Maria emails back, everyone sees:

[Show inbox interface]
- Her complete lead history and score
- Previous conversations and touchpoints
- Recommended next steps from AI
- Team member assignments and notes

No more 'Who's handling this lead?' or duplicate outreach. Your team moves as one unit."

### Section 5: Enterprise Integration (8:00-9:30)
**[Screen: CRM integration dashboard]**

**"LeadNest works with your existing tools, not against them. Watch this Salesforce sync happen in real-time:

[Show data flowing between systems]
- Lead created in LeadNest â†’ Automatically appears in Salesforce
- Lead score and AI insights sync instantly  
- All touchpoints and conversations flow both ways
- No manual data entry, no duplicate records

We also integrate natively with HubSpot, Pipedrive, and 47+ other tools your team already uses."

### Closing & CTA (9:30-10:00)
**[Screen: Setup process - ticking through steps]**

**"Here's the best part - everything you just saw? It takes 15 minutes to set up. Not 15 days or 15 weeks like other platforms.

## ðŸ“§ Sales Email Templates

### Template 1: Developer Outreach

**Subject:** API docs + live testing environment for your lead management evaluation

Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed {{companyName}} is likely evaluating lead management solutions based on your recent {{techStack}} projects.

Rather than another generic sales pitch, I'm sending you something you can actually use immediately:

**ðŸ”— LeadNest Developer Package** (attached)
- Complete REST API documentation  
- Ready-to-test .http collection (import directly to Postman)
- Production deployment checklist
- React/TypeScript integration examples

**Why this matters for your evaluation:**
- 15-minute integration vs 6+ weeks for Salesforce/HubSpot
- Native webhook support for real-time lead scoring
- Built-in rate limiting and enterprise security

**Quick test:** Import our .http collection and try the lead scoring endpoint with sample data. You'll see why our AI processes 10x faster than rule-based competitors.

Would you like me to set up a technical demo with our CTO next week? Or feel free to dive into the API docs first.

Best,
{{senderName}}

P.S. - The .env.example file includes everything you need to get started locally in under 5 minutes.

### Template 3: Investor Follow-up

**Subject:** LeadNest investment materials + $240K ARR traction update

Hi {{firstName}},

Thank you for your interest in LeadNest following our initial conversation.

As requested, I'm attaching our complete Investor Package with:
- Executive Summary (business overview & investment thesis)
- Financial Model Snapshot (unit economics & projections)
- One-Page Pitch Deck (key metrics & market opportunity)

**Quick Traction Update Since We Spoke:**

The lead management market is at an inflection point. SMBs are abandoning expensive enterprise solutions (HubSpot, Salesforce) for AI-first platforms like ours. We're seeing 43% faster sales cycles than competitors.

**Next Steps:**
Would you like to schedule a demo call with live customer data? I can also arrange calls with 2-3 of our champion customers for direct references.

Our Series A round is targeted to close by February 15th. Happy to discuss terms and answer any questions.
