# Sales Objection Handling Guide

**5 bulletproof responses to the most common objections**

---

## ü§ñ "I don't trust AI"

### Response 1: Human Control Emphasis
*"I completely understand that concern - and honestly, you shouldn't trust AI to run your business.*

*But here's the thing: YOU'RE still in complete control. The AI doesn't make any decisions for you or contact anyone on your behalf.*

*Think of it like using GPS instead of a paper map. The technology finds the route faster, but you're still the one driving the car and deciding where to go.*

*The AI just speeds up the boring research work - finding phone numbers, email addresses, and business details. You still decide which leads to call and what to say.*

*Would you be more comfortable seeing how the basic search works first, without any AI features?"*

### Response 2: Optional Feature Approach
*"Great point - AI skepticism is actually smart in the trades industry.*

*Good news: the AI enrichment is completely optional. The core tool just automates Yelp and Google searches - no AI involved in that part.*

*You can use it like a super-fast research assistant for months without ever touching the AI features.*

*And if you decide you want extra contact details later, you can try the AI enrichment on just one or two leads to see if you like the results.*

*Sound more reasonable?"*

### Response 3: Prove with Results
*"You know what? Don't trust it. Test it.*

*How about this: I'll run a search for your exact trade and location right now, and you can judge the quality of the basic data yourself.*

*No AI involved - just automated searching of the same sites you probably already use.*

*If the results look sketchy or inaccurate, we'll call it quits right there. If they look solid, maybe we can talk about the optional AI features.*

*Fair enough? What's your trade and general area?"*

### Response 4: Industry-Specific Angle
*"As a contractor, you're smart to be cautious about new technology. Most AI tools aren't built for the trades.*

*This is different though - it's not trying to replace your expertise or judgment. It's just doing the grunt work of copying contact info from business listings.*

*Same information you'd find manually, just 100x faster.*

*Plus, you can verify every piece of data before you use it. It's like having an intern do the research, but you still check their work.*

*Want to see what the data quality looks like for your area?"*

### Response 5: Gradual Adoption
*"I hear this a lot, and it's totally valid. AI feels like a big leap.*

*How about we start small? Just use the basic search features for a month - no AI, no fancy features.*

*If that saves you time and the data looks good, then we can explore the AI enrichment as an optional add-on.*

*Think of it as dipping your toe in the water instead of jumping in the deep end.*

*Would a basic demo without any AI features make sense?"*

## üè† "I already pay HomeAdvisor"

### Response 1: Different Purpose Clarification
*"HomeAdvisor is great for what it does - bringing customers to you when they're ready to buy.*

*This is for a completely different purpose: finding OTHER contractors for partnerships, subcontracting, competitive research, or supplier relationships.*

*Like, if you needed to find 20 reliable electricians in your area for subcontracting work, HomeAdvisor wouldn't help with that.*

*Or if you wanted to see who your main competitors are and what they're charging - again, different tool for a different job.*

*Are you doing any outbound prospecting or partner research right now, or is it all inbound through HomeAdvisor?"*

### Response 2: Cost Comparison
*"Makes sense - HomeAdvisor works for inbound leads. But let me ask: what do you typically pay per HomeAdvisor lead?*

*Most contractors tell me $50-200+ per lead, depending on the trade and market.*

*LeadNest is $49/month TOTAL for unlimited lead research. So instead of paying $50 per lead, you pay $49 for the ability to find unlimited prospects.*

*Think of HomeAdvisor as your inbound channel, and this as your outbound prospecting tool. They actually complement each other perfectly.*

*Want to see how you could use both together?"*

### Response 3: Supplement Not Replace
*"Perfect - keep using HomeAdvisor for customer acquisition. That's working for you.*

*This would supplement that with contractor-to-contractor prospecting.*

*For example: finding quality subcontractors, identifying potential partnerships, researching suppliers, or analyzing local competition.*

*It's like having two different tools in your toolbox - HomeAdvisor for customer leads, LeadNest for business development.*

*Would seeing some contractor-specific use cases be helpful?"*

### Response 4: Control and Diversification
*"HomeAdvisor is solid, but you're also dependent on their platform and their pricing decisions.*

*This gives you more control - you own the leads, the data, and the relationships. No per-lead fees or competition with other contractors on the same platform.*

*Plus, diversifying your lead sources is always smart business. What happens if HomeAdvisor changes their model or raises prices?*

*Think of this as insurance for your lead generation, not a replacement.*

*Make sense?"*

### Response 5: Immediate ROI Test
*"Keep using HomeAdvisor - it's working for you.*

*But here's a quick test: take your next HomeAdvisor lead fee (let's say $75) and compare it to a month of LeadNest ($49).*

*If LeadNest finds you even ONE good subcontractor, supplier, or partnership opportunity in that month, it's already paid for itself.*

*And you get to keep using HomeAdvisor for customer leads.*

*Want to run a quick test to see what kind of contractor prospects are in your area?"*

## üí∏ "It's too expensive"

### Response 1: Time Value Calculation
*"I get it - $49/month feels like a lot until you break it down.*

*Quick question: about how many hours per week do you spend researching leads, suppliers, or subcontractors?*

*Most contractors tell me 5-10 hours. Let's say 6 hours at $25/hour value - that's $150/week in your time, or $600/month.*

*LeadNest cuts that to maybe 30 minutes per month. So you're saving $550+ in time value for a $49 investment.*

*That's like an 11x return on investment. Does that math make sense?"*

### Response 2: Cost Per Lead Comparison
*"Let's put it in perspective. $49/month breaks down to about $1.60 per day.*

*If you find just ONE good subcontractor, supplier, or partnership opportunity per month, what's that worth to your business? $500? $1,000? $5,000?*

*Even if it just saves you one weekend of manual research, you've made your money back.*

*Most contractors spend more than $49/month on coffee. This actually makes you money.*

*Want to try the free version first and see what you find?"*

### Response 3: Free Trial First
*"Totally fair concern - nobody wants to pay for something unproven.*

*Good news: you can try it completely free. 25 lead searches, no credit card required.*

*Test it out for your specific trade and location. If it doesn't save you time or find valuable prospects, don't pay anything.*

*If it does prove valuable, then $49/month makes sense. If not, you're out nothing but 10 minutes.*

*Sound reasonable?"*

### Response 4: Monthly Savings Comparison
*"I hear this a lot, so let me ask: what do you currently spend per month on lead generation?*

*Yellow Pages ads? Google Ads? Networking events? Trade show booths? Even gas driving around looking for job sites?*

*Most contractors spend $200-500/month on various lead gen activities.*

*This replaces a lot of that manual work for $49/month. So it's actually saving money while being more effective.*

*Plus you can cancel anytime - no long-term contracts or setup fees.*

*Want to see what it could replace in your current spending?"*

### Response 5: Immediate Value Proof
*"You know what? Let me prove the value before asking for any money.*

*What's your trade and general area? I'll run a live search right now and show you exactly what kind of prospects you'd find.*

*If the results are worth $49/month to you, we can talk about a subscription. If not, no hard feelings.*

*Takes 2 minutes and you'll know immediately if it's worth the investment.*

*Deal?"*

## ‚è∞ "I don't have time to learn new tools"

### Response 1: Simplicity Emphasis
*"I totally get it - the last thing you need is another complicated system to learn.*

*Good news: this is actually simpler than your current process.*

*Instead of opening Yelp, searching, clicking through pages, copying info to a spreadsheet, then doing the same on Google... you just type a location and trade, hit search, and download a complete list.*

*It's like using GPS instead of paper directions. Less to learn, not more.*

*The whole process takes about 2 minutes. Want me to show you just how simple it is?"*

### Response 2: Time Savings Focus
*"That's exactly WHY you need this tool - because you don't have time.*

*This actually saves you time instead of costing you time.*

*Your current research process probably takes hours. This takes minutes.*

*Learning curve? About 30 seconds. Type location, pick trade, hit search. That's it.*

*So you spend 30 seconds learning it, then save hours every week using it.*

*Would saving 5+ hours per week be worth 30 seconds of setup?"*

### Response 3: No Training Required
*"Zero training required. If you can use Google or Yelp, you already know how to use this.*

*It's literally: location field, trade dropdown, search button. Same process you're already doing, just automated.*

*No manuals to read, no videos to watch, no complicated setup.*

*Want me to show you a 60-second demo? You'll see exactly how simple it is."*

### Response 4: Immediate Use
*"Here's the thing - you can start using it immediately for real work.*

*No learning period, no practice time, no getting comfortable with it.*

*Your first search gives you real prospects you can actually use.*

*So instead of 'learning a new tool,' you're just 'getting leads faster.'*

*Sound more appealing when you think of it that way?"*

### Response 5: Assistant Approach
*"Fair point - you're busy running a business.*

*What if your office manager, spouse, or assistant could handle this? It's so simple that anyone can run searches and export the results.*

*You don't have to learn it yourself - just have someone else find the prospects and hand you the contact list.*

*Would that work better for your situation?"*

## üîß "My current process works fine"

### Response 1: Enhancement Not Replacement
*"That's awesome - having a lead generation process that works puts you ahead of 80% of contractors.*

*I'm not trying to fix something that's broken. I'm wondering if we could make something good even better.*

*Quick question: about how long does your current process take per week, and how many qualified prospects do you typically find?*

*If I could show you how to get the same quality results in 90% less time, would that be interesting even if your current method works?"*

### Response 2: Efficiency Multiplier
*"Love hearing that - so many contractors struggle with lead gen.*

*What does your current process look like? Yelp searches? Google research? Networking?*

*I'm not suggesting you change what works. But what if you could do the same thing 10x faster?*

*Like, if you currently spend 4 hours and find 20 good prospects, what if you could spend 20 minutes and find 50 prospects?*

*Same process, just accelerated. Make sense?"*

### Response 3: Scaling Opportunity
*"Perfect - having a process that works is huge.*

*But here's a thought: what if you wanted to scale up? Enter new markets? Find more subcontractors?*

*Your current process might work great for your current volume, but could it handle 5x more research without taking over your entire week?*

*This tool is really about scaling what already works, not replacing it.*

*Any plans to expand into new areas or grow the business?"*

### Response 4: Competitive Advantage
*"Great to hear! You're ahead of most contractors who don't have any systematic approach.*

*Quick question though: are your competitors using the same manual methods you are?*

*If you could do the same research in a fraction of the time, that's more time for actual business development, client relationships, or project management.*

*Think of it as sharpening your saw - making a good process even more efficient.*

*Interested in seeing what that efficiency gain would look like?"*

### Response 5: Backup and Diversification
*"Smart to stick with what works - no argument there.*

*But what happens if your current method becomes less effective? Platforms change, markets shift, competition increases.*

*This could be a backup method - something in your toolkit for when you need to quickly research new markets, find emergency subcontractors, or explore partnership opportunities.*

*Insurance for your lead generation, not a replacement.*

*Make sense to have options?"*
