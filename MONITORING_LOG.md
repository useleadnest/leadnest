# 🔄 CONTINUOUS MONITORING UPDATE

## ⏰ **Current Time: 09:50 AM**

### **Backend Status:** 
- **URL**: https://leadnest-backend-2.onrender.com/health
- **Status**: Still starting up (3+ minutes - slightly longer than usual)
- **Progress**: Environment variables injected, finalizing startup
- **Expected**: Should be ready within next 1-2 minutes

### **Frontend Status:**
- **URL**: https://useleadnest.com
- **Status**: Deployment in progress on Vercel
- **Build**: Completed successfully with new backend URL
- **Expected**: Should be live soon

## 📊 **Troubleshooting Notes:**

### Why Backend is Taking Longer:
1. **Cold Start**: Free tier services can take 2-5 minutes initially
2. **Dependencies**: Installing Python packages and starting FastAPI
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL connection initialization
4. **Environment Setup**: Loading all environment variables

### Normal Startup Sequence:
✅ Request detected
✅ Service waking up  
✅ Compute resources allocated
✅ Instance prepared
✅ Environment variables injected
🔄 Finalizing startup (current stage)
⏳ Application ready

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**
1. Continue monitoring backend (check every 30-60 seconds)
2. Once backend returns JSON health response
3. Test frontend connection to backend
4. Validate full registration flow

## 📝 **Backup Plan:**
If backend takes more than 5 minutes:
- Check Render dashboard for deployment logs
- Verify environment variables are correctly set
- May need to trigger manual redeploy

**Status: Everything normal, just waiting for services to fully start** ⏳
