## 🔄 Follow-Up Scripts

### If They Show Interest:
*"Great! I'd love to set up a quick 15-minute call to show you how this would work specifically for your business. What does your lead generation process look like now?"*

### If They Seem Hesitant:
*"I totally get it—new tools can be overwhelming. How about this: try the free version for a week, no credit card required. If it doesn't save you at least 5 hours, just move on. Fair enough?"*

### If They Ask About Pricing:
*"The Professional plan is $49/month, but think about it this way: if it saves you 8 hours per week at $25/hour value, that's $800+ in time savings monthly. It literally pays for itself 16x over."*
