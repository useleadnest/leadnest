## ðŸ“ž DEMO SCRIPT OUTLINE

### Opening (1 minute)
"Thanks for jumping on! I saw [business name] and knew LeadNest would be perfect for you. Can you tell me - how many calls or texts do you think you miss when you're busy with clients?"

### Problem Discovery (2 minutes)  
"That's exactly what we built this for. Most service businesses lose 40-60% of potential customers because they can't respond fast enough. Have you ever had that happen?"

### Solution Demo (5 minutes)
"Let me show you how it works..." [Screen share the dashboard]

### Close (2 minutes)
"I can have you set up and live within 24 hours. We're doing our first 5 clients at founders' pricing - $197/month instead of $497. And here's the guarantee: if it doesn't book you at least one appointment this week, you don't pay. Fair enough?"
