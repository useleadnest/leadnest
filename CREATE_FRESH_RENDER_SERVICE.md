🚨 RENDER SERVICE IS CORRUPTED - CREATE NEW SERVICE
===================================================

💀 RENDER ISSUE CONFIRMED:
- requirements.txt is EMPTY (just comments)
- render.yaml says: python server_pure.py  
- ALL conflicting configs deleted
- BUT Render STILL installs FastAPI and runs uvicorn!
- This means the Render service has HARDCODED/CACHED settings

✅ SOLUTION: CREATE BRAND NEW RENDER SERVICE

1. 🔄 **Create Fresh Render Service:**
   - Go to Render Dashboard
   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"  
   - Connect to GitHub repo: contractornest
   - Branch: main
   - Root Directory: backend

2. 🔧 **Manual Service Configuration:**
   - Name: `leadnest-api-fresh`
   - Runtime: Python
   - Build Command: `echo "Pure Python - No build needed"`
   - Start Command: `python server_pure.py`
   - Instance Type: Free

3. 🌍 **Environment Variables:**
   - PYTHON_VERSION: 3.8.18 (optional)

4. 🚀 **Deploy:**
   - Click "Create Web Service"
   - Let it deploy with clean settings

📋 WHAT THIS WILL DO:
- Fresh service = no cached/corrupted settings
- Will use our EMPTY requirements.txt 
- Will run: python server_pure.py
- server_pure.py = Pure Python HTTP server
- Should work with ANY Python version

🎯 EXPECTED SUCCESS:
https://leadnest-api-fresh.onrender.com/
Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "leadnest-api", 
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "message": "Pure Python HTTP Server - NO DEPENDENCIES!"
}
```

🗑️ AFTER SUCCESS:
- Delete the old corrupted "leadnest-api-final" service
- Update frontend to use new API URL

**This is the ONLY way to bypass Render's corrupted cache!**
